1. React:
___________________

React was developed at Facebook and first released in 2013. It is widely used at Facebook, Airbnb, PayPal, Walmart. 
Its a library rather than a framework. Its not complete solution to build webapp. We can choose our own solutions for functions like 
Routing, State Management. Many users relies on libraries like Redux.

Everything in React is Javascript with JSX to express HTML. 

Advantage of using React is lets developers use the React codebase they use on the web to quickly generate/build 
native applications for IOS/Android. That way they have shared codebase for UX/UI between the web and mobile apps. 

With React Native, your component can generate native-rendered mobile apps for both Android and IOS.

There is a fairly steep learning curve for React because of JSX and other packages like Redux. 

React is fairly easy to debug, as it uses one way binding that make data flow easier to understand. 

React performace is good, React Fiber provides perceived performance.
