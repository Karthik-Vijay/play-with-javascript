Var keyword declares a variable which is scoped to its current execution context, optionally 
initializing a value.

They are not blocked scope so can be accessed from outside the block they were defined.

Let keyword declares a block scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

Const keyword declares constants which are block scoped much like variables defined using 
let but the value of a constant cannot change. The const declaration creates a read-only reference 
to a value.

Blocked scope cannot be accessed from outside the block.
