”Jasper”, what are the key challenges the project is currently facing

ING Netherlands has implemented an agile way of working to deal with customer demands more quickly. This new way of working (in squads/tribes and chapters) gives the teams end-to-end responsibility for a customer functionality.

The tribes consist of squads, with each their own goal. Squads are temporary teams of experts: Customer Journey experts, IT Developers and engineers, Data Analists, Communication Experts and so on.. Depending on the eventual goal of this particular squad. When the goal is reached the squad stops existing and the teammembers go to their next squad. 

ING transforms in a quick pace from traditional bank to 'Bank of the Future'. This also includes the new 'ING Way of Working'. The vast majority of the company works agile, inspired by companies like Spotify and Netflix. This way of working helps us getting things done for our customers quicker. The ING Way of Working offers our employees autonomy and challenges. Because squads and tribes are end-to-end responsible for their products, define their objectives and how they will achieve them.
